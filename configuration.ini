	# DWD Station Name / Number
    # Use : https://wettwarn.de/mosmix/mosmix.html to find closest station to you

    # Station P0031 is closest to my home location:

    # from_history = use historic wheather data for calculation
    # from_file = use wheather data from from file
    # empty = use DWD forecast data.

    # To build up a system consisting of two rooftop panel-clusters (e.g. in my case 7 panels on the east-side
